In this assignment I have to make 2 branches and commit from both of them and then solve the merge conflict.

## initial step

I created two files index.html and style.css and wrote some code in them and then commited with message "first commit" then I created another branches called feature/update-styling and feature/add-content. I made 
both of these branches from master.
I edited same piece of code in both the files i.e. style.css and index.html and then commited them in feature/update-styling and feature/add-content with message "second commit" and "third commit" respectively.
Doing so created a merge conflict. Here is the screenshot of merge conflict.

In order to resolve the conflict I selected the changes that I want to make and I accepted them (accept incoming changes). After that I opened merge editor and resolved the changes and completed merge.
